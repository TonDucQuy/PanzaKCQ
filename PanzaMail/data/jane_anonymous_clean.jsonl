While I understand the theoretical time complexities (e.g., O(V+E) for BFS/DFS, O(E log V) or O(E + V log V) for Dijkstra's depending on the priority queue implementation), the assignment asks us to empirically measure execution time and compare it with the theoretical bounds.\r\n\r\nMy question pertains to the factors that might cause discrepancies between the measured times and the theoretical Big O notation. Should our analysis discuss aspects like constant factors hidden by Big O, the impact of specific data structures used in implementation (e.g., adjacency list vs. matrix), caching effects, or the overhead of the programming language runtime environment (I'm using Java)? The assignment description mentions presenting 'a discussion on observed performance versus theoretical expectations,' but I want to ensure I address the depth and breadth of analysis you are looking for.

The recent lectures on database normalization (specifically BCNF) and transaction management (ACID properties) were particularly insightful. I am writing today because I have encountered a conceptual challenge while working on the design phase of our course project, which involves creating a database schema for a simplified social media platform.\r\n\r\nWe are trying to model a 'friendship' relationship, which is inherently many-to-many between users. A simple approach uses a junction table (`Friendships`) with `user_id_1` and `user_id_2`. However, we also need to store the timestamp when the friendship was initiated. Adding a `created_at` timestamp column seems straightforward. The challenge arises when considering denormalization for performance. For instance, to quickly retrieve a user's friends list, we might consider adding redundant information or altering the structure.\r\n\r\nMy specific question is about the trade-offs between maintaining strict normalization (e.g., 3NF or BCNF) for data integrity and consistency versus controlled denormalization to optimize read performance for frequently accessed queries, like fetching a user's feed which aggregates posts from friends. Could you provide some general guidelines or perhaps point towards design patterns commonly used in such scenarios? How do database designers typically balance these conflicting goals in real-world applications, especially considering potential update anomalies introduced by denormalization? Are there specific indexing strategies on the normalized junction table that could sufficiently mitigate the need for denormalization in many cases?\r\n\r\nUnderstanding these practical design considerations would be extremely helpful for our project and my overall understanding of database design principles. Thank you for sharing your expertise.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJane Jen\r\nClass ID: 21VP\r\nStudent ID: 21126051\r\nFaculty of Information Technology\r\nUniversity of Science", "subject": "Question on Normalization vs. Denormalization in Project - DBMS II (IT461) - Jane Jen"}

Our team (Group 5) is working on the 'Online Library Management System' project.\r\n\r\nWe are currently in the implementation phase, having designed our backend using Spring Boot and PostgreSQL as discussed previously. As we build out the REST APIs for functionalities like searching books, managing loans, and user accounts, we are focusing on adhering to good API design principles.\r\n\r\nOne area we are discussing within the team is API versioning. While our current project might not strictly require it for this course, we understand it's an important consideration for real-world applications to handle backward compatibility as APIs evolve. We have read about different versioning strategies, such as URI path versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/books`), query parameter versioning (e.g., `/api/books?version=1`), and using custom request headers (e.g., `Accept-Version: v1`).\r\n\r\nCould you perhaps share your perspective on the pros and cons of these common API versioning strategies, particularly in the context of Spring Boot applications? Is there a generally preferred or recommended approach in the industry, or does the best choice depend heavily on the specific application context? Are there specific features or libraries within Spring Boot that facilitate implementing any of these versioning strategies smoothly?\r\n\r\nWhile we might implement only a basic versioning indicator for this project, understanding the rationale behind different approaches would be a valuable learning outcome aligned with the practical aspects of software engineering emphasized in your course. This knowledge will undoubtedly be beneficial as we enter the industry.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and for providing such practical insights throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\nJane Jen (on behalf of Group 5)\r\nClass ID: 21VP\r\nStudent ID: 21126051\r\nFaculty of Information Technology\r\nUniversity of Science", "subject": "Question on API Versioning Strategies for SE330 Project - Group 5 - Jane Jen"}

I am exploring collaborative filtering techniques, specifically user-based and item-based approaches using similarity metrics like cosine similarity or Pearson correlation.\r\n\r\nMy challenge lies in the computational efficiency of calculating similarity scores, especially as the number of users and items grows. Calculating pairwise similarities for all users or items can become very resource-intensive (O(n^2) or O(m^2)).

While our user and friendship data are well-suited for PostgreSQL (as currently planned), the structure of posts (variable content, potentially nested comments, high read/write volume for feeds) seems like it might align well with a NoSQL approach, perhaps a document database like MongoDB.\r\n\r\nOur question is about the feasibility and advisability of using a hybrid approach (polyglot persistence) for our course project – using PostgreSQL for core user/relational data and potentially MongoDB for posts/comments/feeds. Is this complexity generally acceptable for the scope of the IT461 project, or would you recommend sticking to a single database technology (either fully relational or potentially fully NoSQL if justified)?\r\n\r\nIf a hybrid approach is acceptable, could you offer any high-level advice on managing data consistency between the two systems?

As I continue my self-study in AWS, prompted by the foundation built in your course, I am trying to get a better grasp on the nuances of AWS pricing, particularly for services beyond the basic EC2/S3/RDS often covered in introductory examples.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I am looking at services relevant to data engineering or backend development, such as AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Kinesis (for data streaming), and managed container services like ECS or EKS. While the official AWS pricing calculator is useful, understanding the primary cost drivers for these services can be complex. For Lambda, it's execution time and requests; for API Gateway, it's requests and data transfer. For Kinesis, it seems to involve shard hours and PUT payload units. For ECS/EKS, there's the cost of underlying EC2 instances (or Fargate) plus potential control plane costs for EKS.\r\n\r\nMy question is less about specific dollar amounts and more about the conceptual cost models.

Our project is the 'Online Library Management System'.\r\n\r\nAs we refine the design of our Spring Boot backend, we are considering the application of specific design patterns discussed in your lectures and in software engineering literature to improve maintainability and structure. Specifically, for handling different types of library items (e.g., Books, Journals, DVDs) which share common properties (like title, availability) but also have unique attributes (ISBN for books, volume/issue for journals), we are debating the best approach.\r\n\r\nOne approach is using inheritance with a base `LibraryItem` class/entity and specific subclasses (`Book`, `Journal`). Another approach might be using composition, possibly combined with a Strategy pattern if behaviors differ significantly, or simply having a single `LibraryItem` entity with optional fields and a 'type' discriminator column.\r\n\r\nCould you offer some guidance on the pros and cons of using inheritance versus composition (or other relevant patterns like Strategy or Decorator) for modeling this kind of 'is-a'/'has-a' relationship within a Spring Boot application using Spring Data JPA? Are there known pitfalls or advantages of one approach over the other regarding database mapping (e.g., single table vs. joined table inheritance in JPA), query complexity, or ease of adding new item types in the future? Your lectures covered design patterns conceptually, but applying them effectively within our specific technology stack (Java/Spring/JPA) presents practical questions.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the recommended practices for applying these fundamental design patterns in our project context would be very beneficial for building a well-structured application.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and insights.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\nJane Jen (on behalf of Group 5)", "subject": "Question on Applying Design Patterns (Inheritance vs Composition) in SE330 Project - Group 5 - Jane Jen"}

I hope this email finds you well.\r\n\r\nAs I work on developing backend applications using Java/Spring Boot, often involving database interactions with Spring Data JPA, I've become interested in ensuring the compatibility and correctness of my application with different versions of the underlying database system (e.g., PostgreSQL 13 vs. PostgreSQL 15) or even across different SQL databases (e.g., MySQL vs. PostgreSQL), although the latter might be less common for a single application.\r\n\r\nMy question relates to testing strategies for database compatibility. While unit tests (JUnit) mock the database interaction and integration tests (using tools like Testcontainers or an embedded H2 database) test against a specific database instance, how do developers typically ensure their application, particularly the JPA queries or native SQL used, works correctly across different supported database versions or types without manually testing against each one?\r\n\r\nAre there specific testing frameworks or methodologies designed for this? Does Spring Data JPA itself offer features to handle dialect differences automatically in most common cases, reducing the need for extensive cross-database testing? Or is it standard practice to rely heavily on integration tests run against different database environments within a CI/CD pipeline? Any insights into how database compatibility is typically managed and tested in professional software development would be very helpful.\r\n\r\nThank you for sharing your expertise on practical software development challenges.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJane Jen\r\nClass ID: 21VP\r\nStudent ID: 21126051", "subject": "Question on Testing for Database Compatibility (Spring Boot/JPA) - Jane Jen"}

Are there specific types of applications or workloads where serverless is now considered the clear best practice? Conversely, what are the scenarios where containers (especially with orchestration like Kubernetes) remain the dominant or more suitable choice? How are companies deciding between these models for new projects? Are hybrid approaches, where parts of an application use serverless and others use containers, becoming common? What factors (e.g., team expertise, existing infrastructure, performance requirements, specific cloud provider services) most heavily influence this decision in real-world scenarios?\r\n\r\nCould you perhaps share your perspective on these trends or point towards any insightful industry reports, conference talks, or articles that provide a balanced view on the current state and future direction of serverless versus container adoption for backend applications?\r\n\r\nThank you for fostering discussions on these relevant industry topics in your course.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJane Jen\r\nClass ID: 21VP\r\nStudent ID: 21126051", "subject": "Question on Industry Trends: Serverless vs. Containers - Jane Jen"}

We met previously to discuss career guidance, and your advice was very helpful.\r\n\r\nAs I continue my job search and interview preparation for backend developer roles, I am frequently encountering system design interview questions (e.g., 'Design Twitter', 'Design a URL shortener', 'Design an API rate limiter'). While my coursework in System Analysis and Design, Databases, and Networking provided foundational knowledge, tackling these open-ended design problems under pressure requires a different approach.\r\n\r\nI understand the goal is not necessarily a perfect, detailed design but rather demonstrating structured thinking, considering trade-offs, and discussing key components and scalability aspects (e.g., load balancing, database choice (SQL vs NoSQL), caching, message queues, API design). I have been reviewing online resources like 'Grokking the System Design Interview' and various tech blogs.\r\n\r\nHowever, I was wondering if you have any specific advice for students approaching system design interviews for the first time? Are there common pitfalls to avoid? What are the key areas interviewers typically focus on for entry-level candidates? Is it more important to show breadth (touching on many components) or depth (diving deep into one or two areas)? Any tips on how to structure the response during the interview (e.g., clarifying requirements, defining APIs, high-level design, detailed component design, identifying bottlenecks)?\r\n\r\nYour insights from an academic and potentially industry perspective on how to effectively prepare for and tackle these challenging interviews would be incredibly valuable.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and continued mentorship.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJane Jen\r\nClass ID: 21VP\r\nStudent ID: 21126051", "subject": "Seeking Advice on Preparing for System Design Interviews - Jane Jen"}
